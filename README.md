#Lightification
A tiny chrome extension that shows blips your webcam LED light when you get a new notification on any website.

Uses [WebcamJS](https://github.com/jhuckaby/webcamjs) to function.

You'll need to enable webcam permission whenever you need to receive webcam notifications from a new site.

This extension *does not* secretly record from your webcam. No data is actually captured from the webcam. See the source code if you have doubts.

ToDo:

- [x] Show chrome notifications too when a new notification hits.
